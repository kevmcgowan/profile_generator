# Module 12 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Instructions

* Run the app by invoking:
```bash

    * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**’s:
      * Name
      * Employee ID
      * Email address
      * Office number
    * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
      * Add an engineer
      * Add an intern 
      * Finish building the team
    * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
      * Engineer's Name
      * ID

      * GitHub username
